<h1> Simple HTML page with upstream messaging </h1>

<p>Create a simple HTML page with multiple product prices, and add a single customized Upstream Messaging Placement Element that changes based on the price selected. For example, if the page has options for $100, $250, and $500, and the element is configured with 6 installments:
<ul>
  <li>If the user selects the $100 option, we’d expect to see the element display $17/month.</li>
  <li>If the user selects the $250 option, we’d expect to see the element display $42/month.</li>
  <li>If the user selects the $500 option, we’d expect to see the element display $83/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The number of amounts to choose from, the number of installments to configure, and the customizations done to the element are up to you.
