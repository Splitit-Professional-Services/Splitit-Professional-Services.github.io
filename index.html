<H1> Splitit Integration Exercises </h1>

  <p>These exercises were originally meant to be administered to new hires on the Professional Services team.
    It is up to the individual to determine how best to complete these tasks (meaning we have no preferences on programming languages or hosting platforms used).
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything needed to complete this test can be found in the Splitit Developers Center, and we are always here to help.
  </p>

  <p>This will be a growing set of integration exercises designed to flex Professional Services' knowledge of the Splitit integration methods.</p>

  <h2> Goal </h2>
  <p>The goal here is to help uplevel the skillset of the members of the PS Team. This is not a test, but rather an opportunity to learn.</p>
